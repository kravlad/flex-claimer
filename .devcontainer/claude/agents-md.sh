#!/bin/sh
# Usage: agents-md.sh <dir> <agents-md>
#
# Runs on the host from initializeCommand (claude/devcontainer.json) and
# makes <dir>/CLAUDE.md, the source of the read-only mount at the
# container's ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md, a symlink to the host user's global
# instructions (docs/specs/devcontainer-host-config.md). <agents-md> is
# $HOSTRUNNER_AGENTS_MD on the host, empty when it is not set.
#
# The symlink always exists, so the mount works on any host: unset, it
# points to an empty file. Docker and Podman resolve it when the container
# starts and mount the original itself, so in-place edits on the host are
# seen in the running container; nothing is copied.
#
# From the devcontainer template (github.com/kravlab/devcontainer-template),
# which owns this file: `copier update` updates it and merges local edits.
# The specs named here are in its docs/specs/.

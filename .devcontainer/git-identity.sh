#!/bin/sh
# Usage: git-identity.sh <dir>
#
# Runs on the host from initializeCommand (both devcontainer.json files) and
# writes the host user's git identity, and nothing else of the host's git
# config, to <dir>/gitconfig, which the containers mount read-only at
# /run/host-config and include from the image's system git config
# (docs/specs/devcontainer-host-config.md).
#
# The identity comes from the global config only: in the Claude container
# the agent can redirect host git to a repository config it writes, so it
# must not choose the author. --includes (off by default with --global) and
# running in the workspace, one level above this script, keep identities set
# through includeIf "gitdir:...". A missing value is left out rather than
# failing `devcontainer up`: the container's git then asks for it on commit.
# Any other git failure (e.g. a malformed config) fails it.
#
# From the devcontainer template (github.com/kravlab/devcontainer-template),
# which owns this file: `copier update` updates it and merges local edits.
# The specs named here are in its docs/specs/.
